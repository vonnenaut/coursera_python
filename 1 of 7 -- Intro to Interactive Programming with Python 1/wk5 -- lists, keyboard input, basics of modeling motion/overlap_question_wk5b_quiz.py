# Convert the following specification into code. Do the point and  rectangle ever overlap?
# A point starts at [10, 20]. It repeatedly changes position by [3, 0.7] â€” e.g., under button or timer control. Meanwhile, a rectangle stays in place. Its corners are at [50, 50] (upper left), [180, 50] # (upper right), [180, 140] (lower right), and [50, 140] (lower left).
# To check for overlap, i.e., collision, just run your code and check visually. You do not need to implement a point-rectangle collision test. However, we encourage you to think about how you would implement such a test.
