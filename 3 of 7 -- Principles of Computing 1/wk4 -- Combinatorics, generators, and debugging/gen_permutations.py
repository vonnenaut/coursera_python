# Coding gen_all_holds
# Implementing gen_all_holds is one of the main challenges of this mini - project. While its implementation is short, the actual code requires thought. Since tuples are immutable, your algorithm for computing the required set of tuples cannot directly delete from the tuple hand. Instead, gen_all_holds should compute the set of all possible holds in a manner very similar to that of gen_all_sequences. In particular, your implementation should iterate over the entries of hand and compute all possible holds for the first k entries in hand using all possible holds for the first kâˆ’1 entries of hand.
